## simpleFoamTemp
A custom openFoam solver with a temperature field added to the default simpleFoam solver. 
The solver was built following the tutorial slides provided at www.cloudpyme.eu, under "Solver development in OpenFoam - CloudPyme"

### flow past a heated square

This openFoam test case uses the solver to simulate the flow of a fluid past a heated square in a straight rigid channel.
