## simpleFoamTemp
A custom openFoam solver with a temperature field added to the default simpleFoam solver. 
The solver was built following the tutorial slides provided at www.cloudpyme.eu (http://www.cloudpyme.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/OpenFOAM2/Session4-Slides.pdf), under "Solver development in OpenFoam - CloudPyme"

### flow past a heated square

This openFoam test case uses the solver to simulate the flow of a fluid past a heated square in a straight rigid channel. 

### Pitzdaily tutorial with a heated top boundary

This test case uses the solver to run the pitzDaily tutorial provided in openFoam, with a heated top boundary
